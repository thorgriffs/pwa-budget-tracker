# Bootcamp Homework 18 - PWA: Offline Budget Tracker
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
## Description
This is a coding bootcamp homework assignment to update existing code for a Budget Tracker to allow for offline access and functionality.  The application allows users to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection.  When transactions are entered offline, the transactions populate the total when brought back online.  The application code for the Budget Tracker was provided. I added a web manifest, service worker, and IndexedDB to convert this to a Progressive Web Application that is accessible offline.

## Usage
The [Budget Tracker](https://tranquil-wildwood-98870.herokuapp.com/) application runs in the browser.  The application can be installed on a user's desktop or added to a user's home screen on a mobile device.  

Enter a new expense or deposit.  The app will display the budget balance along with a chart of all transactions.  Transactions can be entered whether a user is online or offline.
